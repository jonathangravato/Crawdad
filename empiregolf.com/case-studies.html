													Empire Golf has developed the Golf Shop at Ancil Hoffman into one of the most successful \x{201c}on course\x{201d} retail operations in Northern California.ÿ With retail sales exceeding $650,000 annually, sales at Ancil Hoffman have tripled under Empire Golf\x{2019}s management.ÿ This represents averages sales of over $9 per round of golf played, or $520 per square foot of shop space annually.ÿ Statistically, this ranks Ancil Hoffman\x{2019}s golf shop among the top five percent in retail sales nationally.ÿ It is also the second highest grossing \x{201c}on course\x{201d} golf shop in Sacramento.<li>

													Dates of Service:ÿApril 2005 to present
													The Oakmont Golf Club is a 36-hole semi-private club located in the heart of the Sonoma County wine country in Santa Rosa, California.ÿ Oakmont is a member owned club with over 600 proprietary members, and plays over 75,00 rounds annually on its ÿtwo 18-hole Ted Robinson designed golf courses.ÿ A full service restaurant and lounge, wedding/banquet facilities for groups of up to 300, two fully equipped golf shops and a double-ended driving range compliment the property.ÿ
