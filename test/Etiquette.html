					<p>It is the intention of the new dress Code policy to provide a set of guidelines with which members and guests are expected to demonstrate discretion and good judgment. It is the responsibility of each member to conform to the Dress Code, and to ensure that family members and guests do as well. The fundamental concept of the dress code is respect. Respect for other members, and respect for the Club and its traditions itself. The Board of Directors has instructed the General Manager, the Golf Professional and their staff to administer these rules. They are empowered to refuse play on the course and/or admittance into the clubhouse facilities.</p>
