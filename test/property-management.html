											<li>LA CONTENTA GOLF CLUBÿVALLEY SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA
												Ownership:ÿLa Contenta Investors Ltd., Rod Metzler, Limited Partner
												Empire Golf Services:ÿComplete facility management including golf operations, food and beverage, golf course maintenance, general and administrative, and accounting service.s
												Dates of Service:ÿJuly 1986 to November 2009
												La Contenta is a semi-private golf club, located 25 miles east of Stockton, in Valley Springs, California. La Contenta was purchased by a group of investors led by Rod Metzler in 1986. The facilities at La Contenta include an 18-hole championship golf course, golf shop, bar, restaurant, banquet room, maintenance yard, and golf cart storage facility. The course has a rolling terrain highlighted by lakes, streams, and oak trees.
												In the years under Empire Golf\x{2019}s operation, La Contenta grew tremendously. Under the direct management of company president Rod Metzler, capital improvements of over $2.5 million to La Contenta\x{2019}s clubhouse and golf course took place. The majority of those improvements were financed directly through operating profits. The golf course is now in superior condition and the clubhouse services are of the highest quality, resulting in one of the finest public golf facilities in Northern California.</li>
											<li>FAIRGROUNDS GOLF CENTERÿSANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA
												Ownership:ÿSonoma County Fairgrounds
												Lessee:ÿEmpire Golf Inc.
												Empire Golf Services:ÿComplete facility management including golf course maintenance, golf shop, food and beverage, and driving range
												Dates of Service:ÿSeptember 1992 to November 2003
												Sonoma Fairgrounds Golf Center was a 9-hole executive course with a driving range located inside the racetrack at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds in Santa Rosa.ÿ The course was originally built in 1965 at a minimal cost.
												Prior to 1992 the course was leased out on a year-to-year basis, which prevented any major capital improvements to the course and facilities.ÿ In April of 1992 an RFP was issued by the Sonoma County Fair Board for a ten-year lease on the property, with major capital improvements by the Lessee.ÿ Seven companies bid for the lease, and on May 20, 1992 Empire Golf was awarded the contract.
												Empire Golf began major renovation work in September of 1992, with a completion date of October of 1993.ÿ The improvements included:
												<ul>
													<li>Expansion, redesign, and lighting of the driving range</li>
													<li>Rerouting, redesign, and expansion of the existing course</li>
													<li>Complete renovation of the Golf Shop</li>
													<li>Addition of an automatic irrigation system</li>
												</ul> Improvements totaled over $250,000 and were all well received.ÿ The course and its improvements were highlighted in the fall 1993 issue ofÿNGCA Magazine. Revenue in 1994, the first full year of operations for the newly remodeled property, was up 60% from the previous year, and up 100% from the previous operator's final year.
												Empire Golf proposed and received two three-year extensions to the original contract in exchange for additional capital improvements to keep the facility current. Because of Empire Golf\x{2019}s success, good working relationship with Sonoma County Fairgrounds Management, and public support, both contract extensions were unanimously approved.
												The property continued to grow in popularity and boasted the most successful Junior Golf Program in Sonoma County.ÿ With such programs as \x{201c}Kids Play Free\x{201d}, where every child played free with a paying adult, our Junior Golf Program was instrumental in offering affordable golf to parents and their children.ÿ The course was also very popular with seniors and allowed them easy access and affordability.
												In 2003 the Sonoma County Fair Board embarked on the development of a turf track inside the existing dirt track.ÿ The turf track design displaced six greens on the existing course and necessitated a complete redesign of the course and facilities.ÿ Due to time and financial constraints, the golf course was not seen as a viable part of the project and the Fair Board bought out the remainder of Empire Golf\x{2019}s contract.</li>
											<li>MOUNTAIN SPRINGS GOLF CLUBÿSONORA, CALIFORNIA

												Empire Golf president, Rod Metzler and two investors purchased the Mountain Springs Golf Club in 1993.ÿ Mountain Springs had been open since 1990 and had continually had operating problems and losses.
												Under the management of Empire Golf, Mountain Springs was turned into a successful and profitable operation.ÿ Empire Golf oversaw all aspects of property management and capital improvements.
												After five successful years of operation, a residential development group, who also purchased the surrounding land for residential home sites, purchased the Mountain Springs Golf Club from Mountain Springs Golf Inc.</li>
											<li>ADOBE CREEK GOLF COURSEPETALUMA, CALIFORNIA
												Ownership:ÿThe Duffel Company
												Management:ÿEmpire Golf Inc.
												Empire Golf Services:ÿComplete facility construction and management
												Dates of Service:ÿAugust 1988 to April 1990
												In 1988, Empire Golf formed a partnership with the Duffel Company for the development of the Adobe Creek Golf Course in Petaluma, California. Empire Golf was the construction manager and served as general contractor in the construction of all aspects and phases of the development of the golf course. Empire Golf president Rod Metzler was responsible for all golf course construction management, working with both Empire Golf employees and sub-contractors.
												Rod Metzler worked hand in hand with the Robert Trent Jones, Jr. Company, and Jones\x{2019} chief designer, Kyle Phillips. The goal of this working relationship was to achieve a golf course that was not only well designed and a pleasure to play, but also one that could be maintained to the highest standards with fiscal responsibility.
												In the fall of 1989 Adobe Creek was sold to JGrande Inc. Empire Golf continued to maintain the completed course until spring of 1990. The course opened for play in July 1990.</li>
											<li>LAKE WACO GOLF AND COUNTRY CLUB
												WACO, TEXAS
												Ownership:ÿLake Waco Investors, Ltd.
												Management:ÿRod Metzler, Pat Smithson, Curt Hammond
												Empire Golf Services:ÿComplete property management including golf operations, food and beverage, golf course maintenance, consulting, general and administrative, accounting services, golf shop, and banquet operations.
												Dates of Service:ÿJanuary 1987 to January 2000
												Lake Waco Golf and Country Club is a non-proprietary private club located in Waco, Texas. The property includes 36 holes of golf, tennis courts, golf shop, bar, restaurant, locker rooms, pool, campgrounds, fishing ponds, maintenance yard, and developable land. The properties encompass 300 acres of rolling terrain, mature trees, lakes, and more than 4,000 feet of lake front property on Lake Waco. At the time of Lake Oaks Investors Ltd.'s purchase, the course had been taken over by the mortgage holder, First Republic Bank of Texas. The club's membership had dwindled to less than 225 members and was showing a large operating loss.
												In more than thirteen years of the general partners' management (Rod Metzler, Curt Hammond, and Pat Smithson), the course's membership increased to over 450 and the course is operating at a profit. Operating profits have funded all capital improvements. The property has been given a new look by the remodeling of clubhouse facilities. The major emphasis has been on course playing conditions, service, and the marketing of the product. As the membership grows, we have every indication the club will continue to prosper. Lake Waco's revenue has grown consistently since 1987, and has shown an operating profit annually.
												In 2000 Rod Metzler sold his ownership share to the other two General Partners in order to consolidate his management efforts on a more regional basis.</li>
											<li>CHAMPIONS GOLF LINKS

Empire Golf managed the property and later consulted on operations.</li>
